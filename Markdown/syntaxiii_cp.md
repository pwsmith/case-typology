## That

---

## Intial Evidence

In addition to the vP layer and the TP layer, we will see that the clause also splits into a higher layer. called CP.

- *I claimed she was pregnant.*
- *I claimed that she was pregnant.*

Consituency tests show that *that* forms a consituent with the following material:

- *That the poison was neutralised was claimed by everyone.*
- *It was claimed by everyone that the poison was neutralised.*

---

## Initial Evidence

For some verbs, the selection of a clause beginning with *that* is obligatory:

- **Jason whispered the phoenix had escaped.*
- *Jason whispered that the phoenix had escaped.*

In Gaelic, all clausal complements must have a complementiser:

<table class="example">
  <tr class="example">
    <td>Thuairt</td>
    <td>mi</td>
    <td>*(gu)</td/>
    <td>bheil</td>
    <td>i</td>
    <td>tinn</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="example">
    <td>Say-<span class="sc">that</span></td>
    <td>I</td>
    <td>that</td>
    <td>was</td>
    <td>she</td>
    <td>ill</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="example">
    <td colspan=100>'I said that she was ill.'</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

## Intitial Evidence

Important. The mandatory selection of *that* by some verbs in English is independent of the word 'that'.

Some verbs need to select a different type of complementiser:

- *John asked whether the bus had arrived.*

*Whether* is interchangable with *if*.

- *John asked if the bus had arrived.*

Thus, the selection refers to abstract features!

---

## Category of *that*

What category would a word like *that* be?

D? It is homophonous with a demonstrative...

However, **no other** D elements appear in this position:

- **I said this he left.*

And, as we saw in the previous slide, elements which are not D appear (*if, whether*).

It is quite common in languages for equivalents to *that* to have nothing in common with D elements in the language.

---

## *that* vs. *if*

*that* is a complementiser that is part of a declarative clause.

*if* is a complementiser that is part of an interrogative clause.

Let's assume that these are features: [<span class="sc">Decl</span>] and [<span class="sc">Q</span>].

Verbs that select for a CP have the following:

- ask, [V, uC]
- exclaim [V, uC]

---

## *that* vs. *if*

Do we need to specify the feature as part of c-selection?

Probably not, it seems more likely to be part of s-selection.

*Maintain* must select for a declarative.

- *Julie maintained that the barman was sober.*
- **Julie maintained if the barman was sober.*

This transfers to DPs:

- *Julie maintained her own ideas in the discussion.*
- **Julie maintained her own questions in the discussion.*

---

## Always a CP?

Is there a difference between main/embedded clauses?

I.e. should we assume a null CP for main clauses?

Perhaps, *yes/no* questions:

- *Had the potion boiled over?*
- *Did the magic work?*

A CP layer in the main clause gives the complementiser a position to move into.

## Subject clauses

---

## Subject clauses

Clauses can also appear in the subject position:

- *\[That Jason abandoned Medea\] stinks!*
- *\[That I am here\] proves that I care.*

Two options here:

1. The *that* clause is in Spec-TP.
2. The *that* clause is in Spec,CP, connected to an empty element in Spec,TP.

---

## Why?

It looks strange, but perhaps not.

Initial CPs seem to behave differently to other subjects.

No subject auxiliary inversion:

- **Did that Medea yelled an insult upset Jason?*
- **Has that we arrived proved that we were right to leave?*

---

## Why?

Also, whilst it is possible to have a DP subject in an intital CP, one can't embed an initial CP in an initial CP.

- *That the answer is obvious upset me.*
- **That that the world is round is obvious upset me.*

There is a clear distinction to regular subjects.

In other languages, initial CPs need an actual pronoun:

<table class="example">
<tr class="example">
  <td>Dat</td>
  <td>hij</td>
  <td>kommt,</td>
  <td>dat</td>
  <td>is</td>
  <td>duidelijk</td>
</tr>
<tr class="example">
  <td>that</td>
  <td>he</td>
  <td>comes</td>
  <td>that</td>
  <td>is</td>
  <td>clear</td>
</tr>
<tr class="example">
  <td colspan=100>'That he will come is clear.'</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

## Why?

The benefit of this analysis is that we can maintain out view of the EPP.

The empty element is a null DP.

T needs to check a D feature.

If the intital CP were in Spec,TP, we run into difficulties checking the D feature on T, necessitating adding either a D feature to CPs, or making a whole new analysis for the EPP.
