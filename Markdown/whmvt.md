## What is wh-movement?

---

## Wh-movement is movement

Question formation usually --- but not always --- moves the question word to the beginning of the sentence.

- *Who did Medea try to poison*
- *Who gave a book to the library?*
- *What did Sally give to the library?*
- *Who did Sally give a book to?*

---

## But not necessarily wh

Whilst movement of a question word is the most salient example in English, movement does not always involve a question word.

- *A book, John gave to the library.*

---

## Simple analysis

The question word moves to Spec,CP and T moves to C.

## What moves?

---

## Question words

The phenomenon is often called *wh-movement* because most question words in English begin with *wh*.

- *what, who, where, when, what, __how__*

At the simplest, we can see these as simple wh-pronouns

But, the operation applies to larger phrases as well, so there is a class of wh-determiners.

- *what pen, whose pen ...*

---

## Wh-determiners

We assume that wh-determiners select for an nP complement.

## Wh-elements

It is not uncommon for wh-items in other languages to have clear correspondences amongst the items:

English | who | what | where | when
---|---|---|---|---
Zuni  | cop  |kwap   | hop    | kyaayip
Kiowa  |hà:tèl   |hò:ndé   | hà:yá   | há:oy
Hebrew  |mi   |mah   |'ayin  | matay

This is of course not obligatory.

## Mechanics of wh-movement

---

## Mechanics

Like with subject movement: movement of wh-item is feature driven.

Assumptions:
  - interrogative Cs carry a wh feature/
  - this feature is strong
  - and so forces movement of a wh-item to Spec,CP.

---

## But, but, but

This doesn't entirely work with regards to yes/no questions.

- *Did John buy a candle?*

Here, it's clearly a question, but nothing has moved to Spec,CP.

Also:

- **Did John buy a what?*
- *Who bought what?*

---

## A null element for yes/no questions

As with other cases in the past where we've faced a problem like this, then answer comes from a null element in Spec,CP in yes/no questions.

This null element is called a **null operator**.

It has the semantics of truth:

- *Is it true or false that P*

Thus, it can't stand in for a wh-item, and is only licensed in yes/no questions.
