## Little n and the low structure of DP

---

## Little n

Recall from last time that Agents do not appear in *of*-PPs in nominals.

Why?

The answer will come from a parallel to the verbal domain: specifically, in the same way that VPs are contained within vP, NPs will be contained within nP.

**Nominal Hierarchy of Projections**
- D \> n \> N

---

## \*Agent *of*-PP

- \**The imposition of the government of a fine.*
- *The government's imposition of a fine.*

Same thing happens with verbs: the <span class="sc">Agent</span> can't occur as a post-verbal object.

UTAH: <span class="sc">Agent</span>s generate as specifier of v, daughter of V is a <span clkass="sc">Theme</span>.

---

## Little n

The final structure looks like this.

Note the parallels to the verbal domain:
- Functional head above lexical head
- Movement of lexical head higher

---

## Evidence for n

Binding? Requires a certain interpretation.

- *The consul's gift of the gladiator to himself*
- \**The consul's gift of himself to the gladiator.*

Coordination:

- *Richard's gift [of the helicopter to the hospital] and [of the bus to the school]*

---

## Evidence for n

Do we always have n, or just with <span class="sc">Agent</span>s?

**Always**: If n were optional, then we would not expect the noun to always move there.

Then, there should be cases where the <span class="sc">Theme</span> precedes the noun.

But:

- **The of cake gift to the children.*

## Little n

So, let's assume that n is always there.

## Case checking within DP

---

## Case with Saxon Genitives

![saxon-gen](Markdown/saxon-gen.png) <!-- .element: class="img3" -->

Pronounciation Rules:

- Pronounce \[DP, <span class="st">gen</span>\] by pronouncing everything within the DP and then *s*.
- Pronounce \[DP, <span class="st">of</span>\] by pronouncing *of* and then everything within the DP.

---

## <span class="sc">Themes</span> as a Saxon Genitive

We know from last time that <span class="sc">Theme</span>s can also be a Saxon Genitive.

Why?

If the specifier of n optionally projects, then the case feature on the <span class="sc">Theme</span> will be best placed to check it.

## AP modification in DP

---

## Adjectives

- *The **complicated** analysis*
- *A **stunning** photograph of Jenny*
- *Mary's **striking** resemblance to Sue*

The adjective can separate the head noun from the determiner.

Adjectives themselves can be modified:

- *The [**very complicated**] analysis*
- *An [**extremely stunning**] picture of Jenny*

---

## Adjectives: Two options

Adjectives are modifiers: they are not assigned ϑ-roles.

We assume that they are adjoined to n, given that they appear between the article and the noun.

---

## Other modifiers

However, this is not the case for **all** modifiers!

Some PPs are arguments of the noun.

- *Mary's resemblance to Sue*

## Order and movement in DPs

---

## Recall: Verbs

When we analysed verbs, we saw that languages differ as to the place of their elements.

French raised verbs and auxiliaries to T, English just auxiliaries, and Swedish neither.

Some subjects moved to Spec,TP, others stayed low (Gaelic).

It was the strenght of properties that determined all this.

So, do we find the same within DP?

## Hebrew Construct State

<table class="example">
<tr>
  <td class="example">harisat</td>
  <td class="example">ha-oyev</td>
  <td class="example">'et</td>
  <td class="example">ha-'ir</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="example">destruction</td>
  <td class="example">the-enemy</td>
  <td class="example"><span class="sc">OM</span></td>
  <td class="example">the-city</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="example" colspan=100>'The enemy's destruction of the city.'</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>

<table class="example">
<tr>
  <td class='example'>tipul</td>
  <td class='example'>ha-Siltonot</td>
  <td class='example'>ba-ba'aya</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='example'>treatment</td>
  <td class='example'>the-authorities</td>
  <td class='example'>the-problem</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='example' colspan=100>'The authorities' treatment of the problem.'</td>
</tr>
</table>

In both instances the noun is interpreted as **definite**.

## Hebrew Construct State

Interestingly, one cannot use a determiner:

<table class="example">
  <tr class="example">
    <td>*</td>
    <td>ha-harisat</td>
    <td>ha-oyev</td>
    <td>'et</td>
    <td>ha-'ir</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="example">
  <td></td>
    <td>the-destruction</td>
    <td>the-enemy</td>
    <td><span class="sc">OM</span></td>
    <td>the-city</td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="example">
  <td></td>
    <td colspan=100>'The enemy's destruction of the city'</td>
  </tr>
</table>

And the order of theme and determiner is set:

<table class="example">
  <tr class="example">
    <td>*</td>
    <td>harisat</td>
    <td>'et</td>
    <td>ha-'ir</td>
    <td>ha-oyev</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="example">
    <td></td>
    <td>destruction</td>
    <td><span class="sc">OM</span></td>
    <td>the-city</td>
    <td>the-enemy</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="example">
    <td></td>
    <td colspan=100>'The enemy's destruction of the city.'</td>
  </tr>
</table>
