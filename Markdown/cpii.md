## Non-finite clauses

## Non-finite clauses

**Some weeks ago**:
  - Arguments merge into the structure to satisfy features of the verb.
  - ϑ-roles are assigned to structural positions.
  - DPs must receive a ϑ-role.
  - DPs must reveive at most **one** ϑ-role.

---

## Control

+ *Medea tried to poison her children.*
+ *Odysseus planned to hear the sirens.*

The lower verbs are two-place predicates.

The missing subject in the lower clause is interpreted as the subject of the higher clause.

**How does ϑ-role assignment then work?**


---

## Control

Fundamental problems:
  - The matrix verb assigns a ϑ-role to the subject
  - But the lower one has one too...

**Logic of our approach**: there must be some null element in the lower subject position.

This is called PRO.

- *Medea tried to PRO poison her children.*

---

## ECM clauses

Some non-finite clauses *do* allow for a DP-subject.

- *We believed Zeus to be omnipotent.*
- *No-one expected Agamennon to win.*

The verbs in the lower clause are also two place predicates.

---

## ECM clauses

Curiously, the subjects are in accusative case:

- *We believed them to be omnipotent.*
- *No-one expected us to win.*

Because of this they are known as *Exceptional Case Marking* constructions.

---

## Interim Summary

Two types of non-finite clauses:
  - Control
    - No overt subject
    - PRO
  - ECM
    - Overt subject
    - Accusative case

Not quite mutually exclusive:

- **We believed to be omnipotent.*
- *No-one expected to win.*

---

## C in non-finite clauses

Is there a C in non-finite clauses? Perhaps:

- *I intended __for__ Jenny to be present.*
- *__For__ you to do that would be a mistake.*

PP?

- *I intended \[for Jenny\] \[to be present\].*

---

## C in non-finite clauses

Nope.

- *I was for Jenny that I intended to be present.*
- *For Jenny I intended to be present*

Well formed, but they mean something else.

---

## C in non-finite clauses

The evidence then suggests the following structure:

Also: no PRO with C:

- *Jason intended for him to learn magic.*
- **Jason intended for PRO to learn magic.*

C seems to determine case.

---

## Case assignment by C

Analysis:
  - Finite T does not assign case
  - C *can*
  - The EPP feature is still on T.
  - The finite subject raises to Spec,TP (for EPP), where its case feature gets valued by C.

---

## Case assignment to PRO

So what about PRO?

Assumptions:
  - PRO is a DP that requires case.
  - However, it is only compatible with a single case, called *null* case
  - *Null* case means that the DP carrying it gets no spell-out.
  - *Null* case is assigned by a null C.

---

## Back to ECM

How is <span class="sc">acc</span> assigned in ECM constructions?

Adger proposes that ECM constructions are special in that ECM verbs select either a DP or a non-finite TP.

The ECM verb assigns accusative case to its complement.

- *I expected the sack*
- *He believed him*

---

## Back to ECM

When the complement is a non-finite TP, the subject of the non-finite clause gets into a checking relationship with v in the higher clause.

![ecmcase](Markdown/ecmcase.png)

⇒ PRO is not allowed in ECM constructions.

---

## Summary

Control clause
  - Headed by null C bearing null case.
  - PRO appears with null case

ECM clause:
  - TP selected by higher verb
  - <span class="sc">Acc</span> assigned by higher v to embedded subject.

*For* clauses:
  - headed by *for*, which is a C.
  - *for* assigns accusative to Spec,TP.

## Raising Verbs

## Yet another non-finite clause type

- *It appears that John is an idiot.*
- *It seems that John owns a dragon.*
- *John appears to be an idiot.*
- *John seems to own a dragon.*

Clear relation between the higher and lower subject: the ϑ-role is the same.


---

## Raising


Is there PRO in the last two examples?

**No.** Sentences with PRO require a theta role assigned in the higher and in the lower clause.

- *John tried not to be an idiot.*

There is no subject ϑ-role of *seem* or *appear*.

---

## Raising: Analysis

Assumptions:
  - only one subject
  - both Ts have EPP
  - non-finite T (*to*) does *not* assign case
  - Expletives can be inserted to satisfy the EPP

## Object Control

---

## Object control

Control is not a relation that is restricted to subjects.

But, we also find objects participating in it:

- *Maria persuaded Jaons to desert his family.*
- *Maria forced Jason to leave school.*

*Persuade* and *force* are three-place predicates.

---

## This is **not** ECM

Expletives are not allowed,

- *John expected there to be a problem.*
- **I persuaded there to be a problem.*

---

## This is **not** ECM

- *John expected the doctor to treat the patient.* =
- *John expected the patient to be treated by the doctor.*

- *Jason persuaded the doctor to treat Maria* ≠
- *Jason peruaded Maria to be treated by the doctor.*

## Cross-linguistic implications: V2

---

## V2

Finally, the approach that we have been taking predicts that C could have its own features.

These are usually related in information structure like *topic* and *focus*.

Depending on the strength of these features, we expect variation.

## V2: German

**Generalisation**:
  - Some constituent must appear before the verb in German.
  - This constituent should be interpreted as a topic.

**Analysis**:
  - The \[Decl\] feature on C is **strong** in German.
